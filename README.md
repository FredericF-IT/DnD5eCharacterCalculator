## Needed Python downloads
python3 -m pip install -U matplotlib  
sudo apt-get install python3-tk  
sudo apt-get install python3-pillow  
sudo apt-get install python3-pil.imagetk  

To start the main program:  
Start Analysis.py in the commandline  
All settings are explained inside the file, but most settings in Analysis.py are overwritten with those from Settings.txt    
Extra recommendations for settings at end of Project PDF.    
Extra information and a few test cases are in CharIO.py, which can also be run.  

It is recommended to download the PDF, as the git viewer doesen't show/activate hyperreferences and can be hard to read. 

What part of the report this recreates:  
There is no subset here, the runtime is low enough to reproduce all results with the given settings.
