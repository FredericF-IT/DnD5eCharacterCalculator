For this calcullator, we expect characters to make good choices.
As we only look at martial characters, improving stats like Wisdom or Intelligence is sub-optimal, as they do not enhance our damage.
Increasing an Ability Score only improves the Ability Modifier if the new Score is even.
Taking ASI's will always increase at least one Modifier.
We use point-buy to get our stats. We can never choose more then 15 in any Score.
