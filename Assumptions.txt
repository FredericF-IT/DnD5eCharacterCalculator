Some abilities are assumed to be always active, like the Barbarian's rage giving advantage, or the Rogue's sneak attack from having adavantage (starting level 2).
Many weapon types are reduced to their properties + damage dice, as many weapons differ only in flavour or damage type.
As a character variant gets assigned a weapon on creation, we will assume that they use that weapon type forever.
